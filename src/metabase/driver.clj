(defmacro defdriver
  "Define and validate a new Metabase DB driver.

   All drivers must include the following keys:

#### PROPERTIES

*  `:driver-name`

    A human-readable string naming the DB this driver works with, e.g. `\"PostgreSQL\"`.

*  `:details-fields`

    A vector of maps that contain information about connection properties that should
    be exposed to the user for databases that will use this driver. This information is used to build the UI for editing
    a `Database` `details` map, and for validating it on the Backend. It should include things like `host`,
    `port`, and other driver-specific parameters. Each field information map should have the following properties:

    *  `:name`

        The key that should be used to store this property in the `details` map.

    *  `:display-name`

        Human-readable name that should be displayed to the User in UI for editing this field.

    *  `:type` *(OPTIONAL)*

       `:string`, `:integer`, `:boolean`, or `:password`. Defaults to `:string`.

    *  `:default` *(OPTIONAL)*

        A default value for this field if the user hasn't set an explicit value. This is shown in the UI as a placeholder.

    *  `:placeholder` *(OPTIONAL)*

       Placeholder value to show in the UI if user hasn't set an explicit value. Similar to `:default`, but this value is
       *not* saved to `:details` if no explicit value is set. Since `:default` values are also shown as placeholders, you
       cannot specify both `:default` and `:placeholder`.

    *  `:required` *(OPTIONAL)*

       Is this property required? Defaults to `false`.

*  `:features` *(OPTIONAL)*

    A set of keyword names of optional features supported by this driver, such as `:foreign-keys`.

#### FUNCTIONS

*  `(can-connect? [details-map])`

   Check whether we can connect to a `Database` with DETAILS-MAP and perform a simple query. For example, a SQL database might
   try running a query like `SELECT 1;`. This function should return `true` or `false`.

*  `(active-tables [database])`

   Return a set of maps containing information about the active tables/views, collections, or equivalent that currently exist in DATABASE.
   Each map should contain the key `:name`, which is the string name of the table. For databases that have a concept of schemas,
   this map should also include the string name of the table's `:schema`.

*  `(active-column-names->type [table])`

   Return a map of string names of active columns (or equivalent) -> `Field` `base_type` for TABLE (or equivalent).

*  `(table-pks [table])`

   Return a set of string names of active Fields that are primary keys for TABLE (or equivalent).

*  `(field-values-lazy-seq [field])`

   Return a lazy sequence of all values of FIELD.
   This is used to implement `mark-json-field!`, and fallback implentations of `mark-no-preview-display-field!` and `mark-url-field!`
   if drivers *don't* implement `field-avg-length` and `field-percent-urls`, respectively.

*  `(process-query [query])`

   Process a native or structured QUERY. This function is called by `metabase.driver/process-query` after performing various driver-unspecific
   steps like Query Expansion and other preprocessing.

*  `(table-fks [table])` *(REQUIRED FOR DRIVERS THAT SUPPORT `:foreign-keys`)*

   Return a set of maps containing info about FK columns for TABLE.
   Each map should contain the following keys:

     *  `fk-column-name`
     *  `dest-table-name`
     *  `dest-column-name`

*  `(active-nested-field-name->type [field])` *(REQUIRED FOR DRIVERS THAT SUPPORT `:nested-fields`)*

   Return a map of string names of active child `Fields` of FIELD -> `Field.base_type`.

*  `(humanize-connection-error-message [message])` *(OPTIONAL)*

   Return a humanized (user-facing) version of an connection error message string.
   Generic error messages are provided in the constant `connection-error-messages`; return one of these whenever possible.

*  `(sync-in-context [database f])` *(OPTIONAL)*

   Drivers may provide this function if they need to do special setup before a sync operation such as `sync-database!`. The sync
   operation itself is encapsulated as the lambda F, which must be called with no arguments.

       (defn sync-in-context [database f]
         (with-jdbc-metadata [_ database]
           (f)))

*  `(process-query-in-context [f])` *(OPTIONAL)*

   Similar to `sync-in-context`, but for running queries rather than syncing. This should be used to do things like open DB connections
   that need to remain open for the duration of post-processing. This function follows a middleware pattern and is injected into the QP
   middleware stack immediately after the Query Expander; in other words, it will receive the expanded query.
   See the Mongo and H2 drivers for examples of how this is intended to be used.

*  `(table-rows-seq [database table-name])` *(OPTIONAL)*

   Return a sequence of all the rows in a table with a given TABLE-NAME.
   Currently, this is only used for iterating over the values in a `_metabase_metadata` table. As such, the results are not expected to be returned lazily.

*  `(field-avg-length [field])` *(OPTIONAL)*

   If possible, provide an efficent DB-level function to calculate the average length of non-nil values of textual FIELD, which is used to determine whether a `Field`
   should be marked as a `:category`. If this function is not provided, a fallback implementation that iterates over results in Clojure-land is used instead.

*  `(field-percent-urls [field])` *(OPTIONAL)*

   If possible, provide an efficent DB-level function to calculate what percentage of non-nil values of textual FIELD are valid URLs, which is used to determine
   whether a `Field` should be marked as a `:url`. If this function is not provided, a fallback implementation that iterates over results in Clojure-land is used instead.

*  `(driver-specific-sync-field! [field])` *(OPTIONAL)*

   This is a chance for drivers to do custom `Field` syncing specific to their database.
   For example, the Postgres driver can mark Postgres JSON fields as `special_type = json`.
   As with the other Field syncing functions in `metabase.driver.sync`, this method should return the modified FIELD, if any, or `nil`."
